# Fares K. Alaboud

### Hello there! :wave:

I’m a computer science graduate and artificial intelligence researcher, currently completing a PhD at King’s College London. My current research explores the possibility of modelling complex medication instructions as hybrid models and using planning to give personalised daily plans to suit user preferences such as work hours, sleep schedules and meal times.

I enjoy teaching and currently teach Human-Computer Interaction to final year undergraduate and Masters at King’s. 

I spent most of my time throughout my studies working in different companies (including big banks, medium-sized companies, and small startups). I started my own projects in a number of industries including e-commerce marketplaces, healthcare, social care, and most recently electric mobility. Most have failed, and a couple which did/are doing well.

Outside of work: I read, I design, I gym, and I game.

## How I work

I’m generally referred to as a jack of all trades, which has its pro’s and con’s because although I can contribute to any team and in most environments, it also sometimes feel like I am not delivering to the full extent of my potential.

I also sometimes make decisions quickly in order to reach a resolution as soon as possible, particularly when it comes to the way other people work. This is a valuable trait, but when it’s _too_ quickly, that means I information I based those decisions on wasn’t necessarily enough for me to make that decision. 

When I am under pressure, I tend to put my headphones on and focus into the task I’m doing like a death star [(lower-case d, lower-case s)](https://archer.fandom.com/wiki/Space_Pirates#Quotes) taking aim at its target. 


## Working w/ me

- When you need something from me, it’s best to poke me earlier in the day. I usually come in, make myself a hot drink and look at what I need to prioritise for the day. That’s when it’s best to speak with me. :coffee:
- Never expect me to ask you to do more than you’re capable of, and always tell me if I am. :pray:
- Your family/loved ones and your health comes first, so please always make those two a priority. :heart:
- If you ask for a meeting, I’ll usually ask for a clear agenda. :pencil:
- Never be afraid to hurt my feelings, tell me what you want to tell me no matter how critical you might think it sound. I can only improve if I know what I can do better. :dart:
- If I’ve got my over-ear headphones on, send me a Slack message and I’ll be with you as soon as I can. If you see me without headphones on, feel free to ask for a chat or drop a question (a tip I learned from my time working with [Josh Simpson](https://josh-simpson.me)). :headphones:

## What I do

I am now a part-time CTO at [Otto Car](https://ottocar.co.uk), and have been here since March 2019. 

- I have taken similar roles in the past, but I am very much still a newbie and so I ask that you please let me know where I can improve.
- The best part about of my role is that I get to work with people from every part of the business, and try and solve everyone’s problems. 
- I don’t write as much code as I’d like, but that’s something about my role that I am working towards changing in the near future.

I am also a researcher and teaching assistant at King’s College London.

- I’m very passionate about teaching, it’s probably my favourite thing about being a PhD student.
- I enjoy upskilling and enabling people to achieve what they’re trying to accomplish. 

## Key Values

- **Continuous Feedback:** If you’re feeling too much pressure in your work, please tell me. The only way we can work together well is if you tell me what I’m doing wrong, and for me to tell you what you’re doing wrong. I can sometimes be excessively blunt in my honestly, if that’s the case please tell me also. You can expect me to do the same with you, but I always appreciate that intent is important. Even if something outside of work is bothering you, I will do everything in my power to make sure I don’t make you feel even more pressure.
- **Respect:** Any work environment I want to be in (or want you to be in) is one where every person treats one another with the utmost respect. With my social/ethnic background I can appreciate that we all have our differences, but that’s never an excuse for treating someone with disrespect. 
- **Personal Growth**: I am super committed to making sure that the people I work with hit their long-term personal growth goals. This means I will do everything I can to make sure that you have resources available to help give you the boost you need to hit that next step you’d like to achieve, whether it be related to your career or otherwise.
